##  Overview

Welcome to my collection of React projects! This repository contains various projects I have built while learning and experimenting with the React framework. Each project is designed to help me understand different aspects of React and front-end development.

## Projects
<details>
  <summary>1. Accordion</summary>
  <p>This project is a simple Accordion component built with React. The Accordion allows users to toggle the visibility of content sections, revealing more information when a section is clicked. It’s a great way to manage and display large amounts of content in a compact space. This project demonstrates the use of state management in React, particularly focusing on handling user interactions to dynamically show or hide content. The Accordion is fully customizable, making it a reusable component in various parts of an application.</p>
  
  **Live Demo:** [Accordion](./accordion)

  <summary>2. Bill Splitter</summary>
  <p>The "Bill Splitter" project is a simple React application designed to help users split bills among friends or group members. This project emphasizes the use of React's state management to handle user inputs and calculations. Users can input the total bill amount, the number of people, and any additional factors like tips or discounts, and the app will automatically calculate each person's share. This project showcases the use of form handling in React, along with basic mathematical operations to provide a clear and user-friendly solution for splitting expenses.</p>

  <summary>3. Currency Converter</summary>
  <p>The "Currency Converter" project is a React application that allows users to convert amounts between different currencies. This project demonstrates the use of API integration to fetch real-time exchange rates and perform accurate currency conversions. Users can input the amount they want to convert, select the source and target currencies, and instantly see the converted value. The project highlights how to manage external data within a React app, handle user inputs, and dynamically update the UI based on fetched data, making it a practical example of using React for financial tools.</p>

  <summary>4. Movie Rating</summary>
  <p>The "Movie Rating" project is a personalized React application where you can rate movies and create a list of those you’ve watched. This app allows you to rate each movie and then provides an analysis based on your ratings. It serves as a personal movie journal, helping you keep track of your movie-watching habits and preferences. The project highlights state management and how React can be used to build customized tools that cater to specific needs, offering both functionality and a way to reflect on your movie experiences.</p>
   
  **Live Demo:** [Movie Rating](./accordion)

  <summary>5. Pizza Menu</summary>
  <p>The "Pizza Menu" project is a React application that presents a list of available pizzas, allowing users to browse through different options. This project illustrates how to create a dynamic and responsive menu interface in React. Each pizza item includes details such as the name, description, price, and availability. The app showcases the use of component-based architecture in React, where each pizza item is a reusable component, and the entire menu is rendered based on a list of pizza objects. It’s a practical example of managing and displaying data within a React application, perfect for use in food ordering platforms.</p>

  <summary>11. Atomic Blog</summary>
  <p>The "Atomic Blog" project is a React-based blogging platform where users can create, search, and manage posts. This project highlights the use of state management, derived states, and effects in React to create a dynamic user experience. The blog generates random posts using the faker library and allows users to add their own posts through a form. Additionally, it features a search function that filters posts based on user input and a dark mode toggle for enhanced user experience. The project also includes an archive section with a large number of posts that can be added back to the main blog, demonstrating efficient rendering techniques in React.</p>
