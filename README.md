## Projects
<details>
  <summary>1. Accordion</summary>
  <p>This project is a simple Accordion component built with React. The Accordion allows users to toggle the visibility of content sections, revealing more information when a section is clicked. It’s a great way to manage and display large amounts of content in a compact space. This project demonstrates the use of state management in React, particularly focusing on handling user interactions to dynamically show or hide content. The Accordion is fully customizable, making it a reusable component in various parts of an application.</p>

  <summary>4. Movie Rating</summary>
  <p>The "Movie Rating" project is a personalized React application where you can rate movies and create a list of those you’ve watched. This app allows you to rate each movie and then provides an analysis based on your ratings. It serves as a personal movie journal, helping you keep track of your movie-watching habits and preferences. The project highlights state management and how React can be used to build customized tools that cater to specific needs, offering both functionality and a way to reflect on your movie experiences.</p>
   
  **Live Demo:** [Movie Rating](./accordion)

  <summary>5. Pizza Menu</summary>
  <p>The "Pizza Menu" project is a React application that presents a list of available pizzas, allowing users to browse through different options. This project illustrates how to create a dynamic and responsive menu interface in React. Each pizza item includes details such as the name, description, price, and availability. The app showcases the use of component-based architecture in React, where each pizza item is a reusable component, and the entire menu is rendered based on a list of pizza objects. It’s a practical example of managing and displaying data within a React application, perfect for use in food ordering platforms.</p>
   
  **Live Demo:** [Pizza Menu](./accordion)

  <summary>6. React Quiz</summary>
  <p>The "React Quiz" project is an interactive quiz application built with React. This project allows users to take quizzes on various topics, providing a score at the end based on their performance. It demonstrates the use of state to track user answers, calculate scores, and display results. The project also includes features like timed questions, multiple-choice options, and instant feedback, making it an engaging way to test and improve knowledge. This project showcases how React can be used to create dynamic, interactive learning tools with real-time feedback.</p>

  <summary>7. Steps Tracker</summary>
  <p>The "Steps Tracker" project is a React application designed to help users monitor their daily steps and track progress over time. This project demonstrates the use of state management in React to record and display the number of steps taken each day. Users can input their daily steps, and the app will provide a visual summary, showing trends and helping users stay motivated in their fitness journey. The project highlights the practical application of React for health and fitness tracking, offering a simple yet effective way to visualize and manage personal activity data.</p>
   
  **Live Demo:** [Steps Tracker](./accordion)
     <br><br>

</details>
<details>
  <summary>8. Tabs</summary>
  <p>The "Tabs" project is a React application that allows users to navigate through different content sections using a tabbed interface. Each tab displays a summary and detailed information, with the ability to toggle the visibility of the details. Users can also "like" the content, as the app includes a simple likes counter for each tab. Additionally, there’s a special "different tab" that resets the state when selected, demonstrating how React manages state across different components. This project showcases React's ability to handle dynamic content rendering and state management, making it a practical example of a tab-based user interface.</p>
    
  **Live Demo:** [Tabs](./accordion)

<details>
  <summary>9. Tip Calculator</summary>
  <p>The "Tip Calculator" is a React app designed to help users quickly calculate tips based on the satisfaction levels of both the user and a friend. The app allows users to input the bill amount and specify how satisfied each person was with the service, which influences the tip calculation. Once the bill is entered, the result dynamically updates, showing the calculated tip amount. This project is a practical application of state management and conditional rendering in React, giving users a straightforward way to split and calculate tips based on satisfaction.</p>
   
  **Live Demo:** [Tip calculator](./accordion)
     <br><br>

  <summary>11. Atomic Blog</summary>
  <p>The "Atomic Blog" project is a React-based blogging platform where users can create, search, and manage posts. This project highlights the use of state management, derived states, and effects in React to create a dynamic user experience. The blog generates random posts using the faker library and allows users to add their own posts through a form. Additionally, it features a search function that filters posts based on user input and a dark mode toggle for enhanced user experience. The project also includes an archive section with a large number of posts that can be added back to the main blog, demonstrating efficient rendering techniques in React.</p>
