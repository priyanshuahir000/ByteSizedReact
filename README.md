  <summary>11. Atomic Blog</summary>
  <p>The "Atomic Blog" project is a React-based blogging platform where users can create, search, and manage posts. This project highlights the use of state management, derived states, and effects in React to create a dynamic user experience. The blog generates random posts using the faker library and allows users to add their own posts through a form. Additionally, it features a search function that filters posts based on user input and a dark mode toggle for enhanced user experience. The project also includes an archive section with a large number of posts that can be added back to the main blog, demonstrating efficient rendering techniques in React.</p>
